this sunscreen is all over my feed ano kaya na sa isip ni viy cortez what i learned from this is never trust tlg just because someone who is popular is real in their product recos,Negative
cheap price for the cheap product marketing ni viy facewithtearsofjoy,Negative
i donâ€™t understand why people would patronize these kind of brands like why,Negative

its not worth the hype promise,Negative
ayaw ko yan,Negative
dk if may maganda bang product sa viyline hahaha mej nakaka disappoint 😭😭,Negative
tinipid yung ingredients after ng launch,Negative
Wala namang silbi yang cooling effect e 😂😂😂 hindi rin totoo yung malamig na hanging binubuga,Negative
nakabili ako niyan color purple. mabilis malowbat kapag nasa cooling effect. walang kwenta sa arawan yung cooling effect. ang init din ng buga. sorry honest review lang po😬😅,Negative
mabilis po ma lowbat😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,Negative
it also happened to me yesterday 😖. such a waste of money,Negative
ang hina much better talaga yung normal sayang pera huhuh,Negative
"bat parang may mga defect na yung mga narerelease, especially sa lakas ng fan compare sa mga before pa.",Negative

"Sobrang underwhelming ng launch :( puro creams eh ang init dito. Panget ng packaging, hindi aligned sa marketing on ig",Negative
soo expensive and hard to get :(,Negative
"they have huge servings and fresh ingredients but unfortunately, their sauces are bland and they don't even serve any condiments at all.",Negative
BUMILI AKO DYAN DI NAMN GAYAN SERVING NILA ANG ONTI HINDI WORTH IT 😑😑😑😑,Negative
Masarap sana kaso maasim dahil may vinegar . 😬,Negative
It's just a dupe of milk jelly blush! mas maganda pa yung jelly worth every penny 😫❤️,Negative
so overpriced for no reason,Negative
this isn't the first time nakapanood ako ng bad review about diyan😬 thank you so much for being honest,Negative
Mas blendable pa yung happy pot ng squad na 65 php lang,Negative
Kaya di ako nabili sa happyskin mahal and for a mid prod?,Negative
its giving tints nung hs na 89 pesos na hirap iblend 😭,Negative
anti-budol talaga,Negative
so consistent disappointing us through their products ,Negative
so consistent disappointing us through their products ,Negative
"Tried this sa mall kanina, and gulat ako hindi nabblend. Parang stamp ang peg 😅",Negative
There is no amount of retail therapy that would convince me to buy that,Negative
i also dont like their sunscreen stick 💀 ang mahal tapos ang oily shsyshayagsgs,Negative
price is not pricing,Negative
it’s unreasonably pricey and hard to use. Not worth it😌,Negative
Definitely there are better options,Negative
i will not spend 599 pesos for that inconvenience,Negative
ang hirap ijustify niyang product na yan sa totoo lang,Negative
"Wag na natin igaslight mga sarili natin mhie, kakaiba talaga siya",Negative
TAMA NA KASI! ALAM NAMAN NATIN NA PALPAK YUNG PAGAWA,Negative
"mahal na nga tapos need pa ng diff techniques to work. dapat for its price, it should be beginner friendly knowing na jelly blush lang naman sya.",Negative
ang mahal na ng product tapos tayo magaadjust kung paano siya gamitin 😂😭😭😭 juice ko,Negative
It does beat the purpose if you need to do something prior applying it. I guess Happy Skin's R&D failed to test the product properly.,Negative
ang hassle naman ng tint nato lol,Negative
Super hassle 🥲,Negative
hirap niyang i pag-tanggol,Negative
and for the price....nahh😔😔,Negative
Ang panget talaga jusko,Negative
All these techniques and efforts for an already expensive blush just screams that it's not worth it. Why do people still settle for overpriced local products? I'll never understand.,Negative
not textured skin friendly,Negative
The fact that there’s cheaper option na mas better 😅,Negative
Waste of money. ,Negative
"Total flop, sayang ang money",Negative
"the shades are good naman, but yung formula 😭😭",Negative
defective,Negative
nagleleak siya,Negative
buti hindi pako nakakabili. 😫😅,Negative
why ganun bumabaho pag paubos na,Negative
hirap naman banlawan body wash nyo hahahaha,Negative
masyadong hype ung product but nong ginamit ko drying siya saken at hnde gaanong mabango huhuhu sayang lng,Negative
skin got irritated 😣,Negative
"di siya fda approve. and if ivisit niyo fda site, may warning dun na wag iconsume tong vita bears. :)",Negative
napa utot ako sa presyo,Negative
daming negative effects. di ata approved ng FDA,Negative
sisi ako na bumili ako just bcos it's on sale. sayang 🥺,Negative
FR ANG ISSY HUHU SAYANG ANG NABILI KO SAKANILA WORTH 1.8k 😭 Nabudol me since want kona mag bago ng make up routine yet im so so disappointed 😭,Negative
they're quite overrated IMHO,Negative
Just wanna check if I’m the only one who thinks that the grwm brand is overhyped and not good at all:/ wasted money on their pan blushes&multitints,Negative
Sunnies talaga 🚫 ang bilis matanggal din sa fez lol,Negative
pricey tapos wala pang half day hulas na ng pigment 😂 such a waste😂,Negative
"ang mahal ng sunnies tapos ang bilis matanggal, nagdadry pa kaagad ung product 😭😭😭😭",Negative
Agree on color changing blush oil. Nice natural flush BUT I do not like the oily feeling.,Negative
Same thoughts on the absidy lippie! Sayang ang ganda ng shades :(,Negative
Parang di nagmmix yung lippie 💔,Negative
omg the blush is not blushing 🥲,Negative
grabe nawala yung blush agad 😭,Negative
Formula’s not for me :(,Negative
ganda sana ng coverage kaso sobrang cakey kahit 10 mins pa lang oily na 😭,Negative
"ang sakit sa paa,",Negative
I barely buy that shit bc it feels expensive 😭😭,Negative
the prices are something my filipino genes cannot accept 🥲 lol jk,Negative
i also find the grwm powder to crease and cake esp if ur oily like me,Negative
8g lang ata yung teviant na powder huhu di sulit,Negative
they wont be restocking,Negative
Sunnies face ang mahal tapos mga apologists pa owner 😬,Negative
"I agree with grwm milk tints, bigla nalang syang super messy sa bag ko but it was a good product sana",Negative
it doesn’t set and made my phone’s camera lens so blurred. so hard to wash off din!,Negative
super yellowish nya ang hirap hanapin yung perfect shade 😭,Negative
its a no for me n pla.,Negative
same ganyan din sakin mi... tapos pag tumagal mangingitim tignan mukha mo😭😭😭,Negative
overhype to for me,Negative
"ang lakas ng smell 😭 nagbreak out ako diyan, maybe because of the fragrance it has 🤧",Negative
most importantly yng FDA approval di nila ma tackle so they can't be trusted period!,Negative
Dahil sa Sukee Sunscreen nag ka breakout ako 🙁2 days ko plang nagamit super kati na ng mukha ko..binili ko ng buy 1 take 1 sayang Pera ko.. tinapon ko nalang kaysa ibigay sa iba kase ayaw Kong masira din skin nila🥹,Negative

Parang paiba-iba kasi ung formulation nila :(,Negative
it is just a ripoff brand at this point,Negative
its such a shame thath theyre so close in price point for something that offers almost the same thing. Theres little to no incentive to choose this,Negative
a brand that I really don’t understand,Negative
am I the only annoyed how ph brands just often copy other brands concepts and packaging? Like wheres the originality? Innovate,Negative
I hate it when a brand releases products all the time that the consumers don’t even need. Wdym a duplicate ,Negative
its unhygienic,Negative
okay but do we need another copy 😅 I know innovation is hard but like… 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️,Negative
"ugh, was turned off the moment I saw the packaging",Negative
why do local brands have to copy theur packaging too? Cheap ahh behavior,Negative
I hate when expensive brands take inspo on other brands packaging,Negative

cooler is good for a big roomonly thing that i didnt liked is the the inlet given for putting water manually inside the tankthis cooler is only feasible if you can buy a inlet pipe which should be used to fill the tank by connecting it with tapso for all the buyers please keep that thing in mind before buying it because that point is not mentioned anywhere in the descriptionfan speed cooling capacity and rest of the features are excellent,Positive

its really worth every single penny it works like one ton ac provided that your room has proper ventilation i generally keep cooler near to window so that it can pull fresh air from outside and as a result i get very cool air one more suggestion please dont buy cooler which are equipped with a blower fan always go for the cooler equipped with metal fan like this one in one word this compton cooler is amazing if you find the review helpful please thumps up happy summer,Positive

great packaging by seller as this was the most important point while transportation from jaipur to chennai secondly product is quite huge and air throw is very much nearly 13ft at 2 speed and will give good breeze cooling is satisfying due to honeycomb cooling media no need of filling water daily price is high but product is quite satisfactory compared to others only drawback is the motor power is 190 w rather than 220w which should be coorected on specs information on flipkart good j,Positive

its an awesome product and i am not making any fake comments here i bought this just for trial to have a healthier ambience at home and i am happy that i made this choice it cools a room and keeps it cool all day and its best if you put it near a window or open door so that it pulls fresh air huge savings on electricity eco friendly and comfy,Positive

its been 6 days that i am using this cooler we have 1515 room after buying this cooler what i love is it has strong solid body so dont worry that it get broken easily you can fill water from front and back and give very cool air my room feel like its december in april i have to use extra blanket in night while sleeping it has capacity of 75 litre water which last for 2 days but i love to run cooler on pump for 1 hour it cool the whole room then only air mode and it gives awesome cool,Positive
very good quality product better than my expectations if you provide good ventilation it does nice cooling then i could feel the air 25 feet away couldnt try more than that but i think you could feel it a bit more far away as well water easily lasts for about 89 hours good in this price9200 range after 10 percent discount,Positive
delivery was on time flipkart service was awesome on time but the cooler doesnt seem to be so costly as it doesnt cool really well even after filling it up with full water it can be ok during warm nights but it wont make you feel any ease in hot conditions the plastic build also looks very cheap and below standard i am ok with it but not very satisfied,Positive
water pump is not throwing a lot of water thats why its throwing warm air not satisfied with this kind of pump quality i have paid a lot for this not worth the money there is no work of ice chamber i need a partial refund,Negative
a quality product from crompton it looks exactly like in the website is easy to set up and use please refer the room size charts while buying from the product line this one is meant for a somewhat large room there are 3 speed controls a couple more on the lesser side would have been better the smell from the cooling pads reported in a couple of other reviews was there but mostly dissipated within the first 8 hours of use finally this cooler consumes a lot of water 3lhr so it w,Positive
great job by fk faster delivery awesome product i got brand new air cooler at first i checked its sounds not bad as i read in reviewair delivery is much better one thing to say delivery boy most helpful so guys must go for it but i have doubt is this model same to ozone 55 because i ordered this got ozone 55 according to sailer both r same then why fk shows different model price,Positive
a good cooler by crompton the height of the cooler is about 3ft 10 inch color is nice plastic body is average air blow is good at any stage 12 or 3 air swing is also 3 choice when you switch it on for the first time after filling the water you will feel the nice cold air you will feel cool if you use it according to the weather there is a ice tray on the top overall a good cooler i will give 45 for design 35 for plastic body 45 for fan speed 45 for fan swing,Positive
very bad ever packageing by flipkart i have seen when i open its outer layer its been already open looks like used product air throw quality is not good as expected its water meter is very top of its water tank if you want to see its minimum level of water then u have to fill atlest 50 liter of water no any support of up and down its air wing and its not cover very much area overall just ok not very satisfied,Negative
great product this come with very nice packing by seller not a single crack or scratch in it also its brand new mfg and truly original generally people avoid this type of stuff online but i try also have return policy for any damage so i ordered it and within 3 days they delivered this amazing room cooler now come in price range its little costly but crompton didnt compromise quality major features already you can see in description other than this fan is little noisy and its wit,Positive
its been 10 days since im using this air cooleronce it is on we can feel cool breeze in 10minbut we feel humidity if we use it for more time which is common with air coolers easy to move and fill water cooler need to be drained often knob is down below near wheelsediting here after 3 months use i used hard water for 3months with frequent draining after 3months pump stopped pumping water and releasing hot air once it is oni opened and cleaned pads pump and water distribution pipes,Positive
crompton offers this range of coolers ozone with multiple capacity of water tank though the fan motor and air flow capacity remains the same which should not have been the case i bought the 88 litre model satisfied with cooling but the castor wheels are not strong enough for the weight of 88 litre filled water tank suggestion is to go for 75 litre instead of 88 litre variant,Negative
its vertical swing quality is bad when you set to upward then automatically it goes to down due to this air goes to down we cant set direction as we wantvertical swing is uselesswater filling opening box is too small when u fill with jug many water goes to outside cooler ice chamber is useless ice cube water goes to 88 liter chamber how some ice can cool 88 ltr ice chamber need to direct connect to honeycomb pad and slides that it cool instantlyit make some noise too during,Negative

good air delivery this is its pro and con because of heavy air delivery you cannot use this as fan otherwise this is very good if you live in hot dessert area do not buy if you are from humid coastal area it is not effective by a powerful fan instead,Positive

have been using for almost a month now one thing you definitely need to know is keep the cooler where fresh air ventilation is there otherwise the room will just become humid the cooling for me has not been that great dont know exactly how it provides maximum cooling and not make the room more humid using it in pune climate it partially does the job for me if anyone has had good experience with the product can help me out on how the maximum cooling can be achieved,Positive

i am writing this review after using cooler for a month i would say it is silent enough it cool down your bed room within 1520 mins so you can put it on before going to room as of now i am running it on level on and most of the time i have to switch pump off in mid night as you start feeling cold very effective cooling and run well on inverter excellent build quality you may feel fishy smell for few days but it will go off once you change water,Positive
best in the classextremely light and awesome looks and very easy to maneuver around thanks to the 4 wheels at each corner with wheel locking feature talking about its main function that is cooling so let me tell you it worth every penny and cools the room in around 10 min of medium size it got 5 iron blades which works fine and tank capacity is very large i would recommend go for the lower capacity which would cost 1000 rupees less,Positive
excellent cooler i was actually looking for a plastic body beautifull looking air cooler which can replace iron body exhaust fan cooler in my 500 sqr ft hall though no cooler can really replace the exhaust fan cooler but after using it for a week i can say that this cooler is the best among all and have excellent air throw with high cooling with no noise level and nice looks i purchased it after a lot of research and i am happy with the performance only better option is crompton optimu,Positive
writing this review after using this cooler for 4 months in nagpur where temperature goes till 48 degrees and is an extremely hot regionlight weight sturdy stylish does not make a lot of noise either this cooler will work absolutely fine until march but during the months of april and may when summer will be at its peak it will work only as a personal cooler and youll have to keep it hardly 1 meter away from yourself to feel the cool air,Positive
this is a cooler so please do not expect ac like cooling this provides good amount of cold air the room may become humid in placesregions with higher humidity so please use cross ventilation this is a value for money product and it is pretty big looks very good in room the air throw is sufficient for rooms with 150250 sqft size the delivery was good and the delivery personnel went out of his way to help get the huge package to 2nd floor thanks a lot,Positive
the cooler was home delivered it came in good condition the cooler operation is simple the wheels are sturdy and it is easy to move around the main problem is with the manual the manual does not give details on how to clean the filters and how to drain the water tank the manufacturer could have created a simple youtube video on how to do this and not left it to the amateurs,Positive
its excellentwill feel some odour for 1 or 2 days due to honeycomb but then the smell will gopls dont forget to have some space behind cooler otherwise humidity will increase i felt the same but when i changed locationit if giving wonderful resultsrequires ac comforters after 2 hourswater tank capacity is good and it will last for more than whole night in continuous usewater level indicator is very clear wheels are good and locking system is also there overall worthy and good,Positive
giving this review after 4 months usage this is really good cooler cooling 1211 bedroom within 2 hours but proper ventilation should be there lit it sound is there i think the sound is common for all coolers this is good recommended to buy,Positive
wonderful product as expected reduces the room temperature nice air flow intial use will give a stink smell after first five hours everything seems to be normal ice chamber does its job for best results mix some ice while filling the tank cord length is small but manageable flipkart delivered in a week packing was perfect 5 for now will re review after few weeks,Positive
loved it excellent air thruogh i searched almost 15 days for best cooler finally got good one with reasonable price thanks to flipkart and crompton,Positive
air throw is very disappointingi thought it was a good cooler but its not they mentioned that it is for 450sq feet but it cant even cool my little 150sq feet room in 40 degree temp also i have tried all the way for ventilation but it always creates humidity and thats the bad part i suggest to dont buy this you can even buy a local brand cooler from the show which far better than this,Negative
product is good with good look and compact designairflow is also good while considering for medium hallbut the problem is if you try to adjust ventsblades they will automatically bend downwards due to airforce it would be better if they stand still however we want,Positive
i have purchased this cooler from flipkart its an amazing products value for money you have to use blanket if you run this cooler at high speed even in hot hummid summer guys please go ahead and buy it this cooler can chilled a room size 400 to 500 sqft thank you flipkart i love this product,Positive
after use of one month very nice product work well less sound better cooling,Positive
its excellent product from crompton superb cooling without any sound light weight beautifully designed very good qualitythanks flipkart for amazing producti am satisfied with this purchase thanks a lot to seller and flipkart,Positive
it is old model and dont have outlet for draining dirty water we have to clean it manually and do lot of physical work usually the water becomes stinky once in a month we have to remove the screws and use motor to pump out the water the screws are not stainless steel so they get rusted easily and makes it difficult to remove the wheels get stuck within a month theres no manual how to remove and clean honeycomb the only positive point is its air throwing capacity and ability to cool,Negative
very good productreliable product from the brand not disappointed this tym after returning usha air king which was a wasteyou can go for this one for sure good air thrownice cooling ice chamber castor wheel evrythng working just great only one thing which i want to highlt is just the front louver the osclitor is good working perfectly but the front oscltor should hve been better overall great buy go for it,Positive
value for money but bit noisy good enough for large rooms need good air cross section water capacity is hugegood air throw noisy enough to keep outside cant watch tv while cooler is in room,Positive
i baught this cooler looking at the number of reviews and rating as i always do and as expected cooler built quality is good but the main function of cooling has a design defect the water supplied through the channel has some design defect because of which none of the honeycomb panels gets wet completely and hence cooling effect is very less people may not have noticed this if they are from relatively not that hot places like pune mumbai or bangalore etc i would not recommend this product,Negative
very good product if you have a cross ventilation in your room so this product is so nice for you very less noise and give a instant cool air a little humidity fan speed is very good appropriate value for money,Positive
it is a very good product you must buy it it has three side honeycomb pad and dis cooler gave a very nice air flow its exact height is 10 cm and you dont be hesitate to buy this product it has good swing and nice water tank of capacity 88 litres and i got a good delivery by flipkart and crompton is a good brand,Positive
not a great product the finishing of the product is not look like it is branded one just looks like ordinary roadside product not expected this type of product from crompton i have shared my view after 2 days of usage the 3 star is for its price go for symphony this is not trust worthy,Negative

satisfied with this product super air flow amazing built quality height is good cooling is also good its not offering many features but i think its main function as a good cooler its work best for me i review this after 1 month of used,Positive
cooler is nice but have some drawbacks as well i will focus on only draw backs because whatever feature it claims it has them upto mark 1 it is useful only for one person2 it will work only when proper cross ventilation is available other wise would create unbearable humidity in the atmosphere of your room or house3 front flabs are loos ened after use and they can not guide the air properly so everytime you will have to guide them in your direction it will irritate you especially i,Positive
i would certainly recommend symphony cooler in this range because earlier i hav experience with symphony and now i had purchased this 1 month agosymphony is superior to crompton1 less noise2 better air delivery,Positive
well i was confused between hindware and crompton but finally i went with this only as motor king is crompton only air flow is awesomelight weightcoolness is fantasticif you trust on brand you can blindly go with thiswin win situation thank you flipkart for awesome delevery experience as usual,Positive
crompton 75l desert cooler is the best coolerits cooling effect is very good even in moderate temperaturecooling remains for longer time not only when it is onand it cools large area for effective cooling not like tower or personal coolervery happy with purchase highly recommended for better and effective cooling,Positive
excellent cooler work well only when window are open for ventilation provide decent cooling with water when ventilation is provided,Positive
air cooler is working well giving heat relief from summer heat provided cross ventilation is good less noise its better to connect water hose to air cooler directly and due to water evaporation the 70ltr water doesnt last for the whole nightit has inbuilt wheels sturdy to move across the room highly recommend this product,Positive
excellent air cooler i am very happy and good sellers and good flipkart,Positive
good product on fully hot summer if you are living in place like humidity area it not helps to cool you,Positive

i ama truly satisfied with the product it cools the room very well even if the temperature is more than 42 degree celcius i live in a place where the temperature goes more than 40 degree in the mid summer i stay on the top floor but since i am using this cooler i am having no problem due to excessive temperature which i used to face before you just have to place the cooler in the right place with the right and scientific procedure,Positive
better plastic quality than symphony better price honey comb panelssleek suggest every symphony fan to give it a try as it is better in terms of product quality symphony quality has decreased a lot in few years,Positive
good product given same model which one i choose delivered safely i love flipkart services that i owe till now thanks flipkart team for wonderful job you are doing,Positive
in short it is better than snowcrest 85 which is one of the best air coolers out there crompton machines are less noisy and the air throw is wide and thats where snowcrest gets beaten but on the bright side the latter throws higher volumes of air i personally think that crompton is best for rooms whereas snowcrest from hindware is better suited for bigger halls,Positive
the best in this price range with excellent air throw sufficient for a hall and adequate cooling adequate ventilation is needed to work properlyworks best when kept near a window and another window should be opened to push humidity outwater lasts for 1 to 2 daysthis cooler can make the difference in hot climate when it brings down the room temperature the new smell goes off in a week a good choice to combat summer heatps thanks flipkart for the brilliant delivery,Positive
pros the best cooling out there with 75l liter capacity and plastic used is also really good cons plugg in cable length is not even half meter and huge noise which will not allow you to sleep so what is the point it is like giving you an ak47 without bullet you have a wonderful gun but you cannot use it for the purpose you got it for,Positive

i bought this after comparing over 30 different types of coolers its cooling is good but nothing compared to desert coolers like kenstar cyclone 12 what i observed that the cooling pads at the back are not properly soaked in water compared to side cooling pads this maybe the reason why cooling is lesser still its better than most coolers out there in marketprosit looks classy low noisehuge 70l tankpowerful 180 degree airthrowconsno indicator light no single switch to turn o,Positive

it is worth every single penny i bought this cooler for the indoor room where air ventilation is not much but this cooler performs really well for that room the fan motor is very powerful and the water tank is also has a good capacity it cools the room very well where there is no ventilation if it gets the air ventilation it will perform much better please go for it but keep in mind the service for this cooler is very expensive more than acbecause the honey grass are real expensive,Positive

excellent i recommend it but you need fill drinking water 25ltrs for 10 hours approximately and using soft water drinking is best to retain the water pump life little bit noisy in fast mode useful for 20 x 11 sqft area,Positive
cooler is great but its tough to serve the water into it is little difficult if the water resources are less with you but in terms of cooler its great enough for big hall 25x30ft,Positive

this cooler is very beautiful and very good air comes from this cooler i compared many good coolers but i liked this cooler very much if you guys are also thinking of getting a new cooler then i would advise you to buy this cooler friends if you are buying this cooler then you do not need to pay installation charge friends installation charge this means just take the cooler out of the box because the company will do everything on its side i would request friends to tell that you do not p,Positive

while the fan and motor quality is good the problem with this cooler is its body the plastic is not very strong and the vent in front is problematic as the horizontal plastic pieces do not remain at their place leading to less air flow it is a big let down and request crompton to replace the plastic mesh in future rest of the body is also quite shaky,Negative
